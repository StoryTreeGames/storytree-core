# Zig Native Window Library (ZNWL)

This project is in inspiration of a larger project that I am planning to work toward. However, one of the foundational pieces is the ability to create windows on natively on different devices/systems. That is the goal of this library, a focus on creating
native windows and managing their state and events.

The goal is to get the library cross-compiling without any fuss or problems to Windows, Linux (X11 + Wayland), MacOs, iOS, and Android.

I am fairly new to Zig and it has been a few years since I last programmed in C this project also serves as a learning tool for Zig, system programming, and open source.

I hope to keep all my projects as open source and community based as possible. Any tips, PRs, and overall help are more than welcome.

> üóíÔ∏è Note: Peek [StoryTree](https://github.com/StoryTreeGames) as the larger scoped project inspiring this one. I am currently bouncing between Zig and Rust. Rust would be easier to use with a more mature ecosystem; however, Zig is maturing a lot and is in need of some good packages for the
> new package manager with version `0.12`. If Zig ends up being the language I use for `StoryTree` this repo will be moved to the `StoryTree` orginization.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Warn: This repo is more exploritory and the API is subject to change with every merge into the main branch. To help with the volitile nature this project will be split into a develop and a main branch.
